# Assets / Images

Place all static imagery for the Blue Ocean experience in this directory.

- `hero-bg.jpg` — primary landing hero photograph (recommended size 1600×900). If missing, the app falls back to `hero-bg.svg`.
- `hero-bg.svg` — on-brand illustration used as a backup hero background.

You can add additional images here (e.g., storefront previews, testimonials) and reference them from React components using the path `/assets/images/<filename>`.
